Possible Queries:

Basic:
	- Does a decay path exist?
	- What is the probability of that path occurring?
	- What steps are involved?

Advanced:
	- What is the highest probability path to/from a given destination/source?
	- Which path has the fewest steps?
	- What is the shortest decay path with at least 30% chance of occurring?
	- How many different nuclides can we reach from a given starting point?
	- Is there a path that only uses specific decay types?
